# Fibroblast Signaling Network Model Fitting  
## 10.29.2019 - Jesse Rogers  

This program is intended to estimate reaction parameters for ODE-based networks. Using both a network model generated by Netflux (https://github.com/saucermanlab/Netflux) and previously published proteomics and tramscriptomics data for model inputs and outputs respectively, the program iteratively estimates reaction weights using a genetic algorithm. This program can be run either locally or using high-performance computing resources.

### Required Software:  
- Matlab 2019b
- - Global Optimization Toolbox
- - Parallel Computing Toolbox

### Required Files:  
- Proteomics (model input) data: arranged using Entrez gene symbols as rows, samples as columns, data as log2RFU (for example, see PMID 31511425 SOMAscan proteomics data, Supplementary Table S2)
- Transcriptomics (model output) data: arranged using gene symbols as rows, samples as columns, data as CPM (for example, see PMID RNA-seq data, GSE133529)
- Netflux model: prepared according to Netflux documentation (for example, see snm_1_1_rev3.xlsx)
- PARAMS.txt file: editable file containing all needed parameters for running program
